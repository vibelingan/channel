## CloudBase SDK Contract Gate

Before designing or changing CloudBase SDK, CloudBase Storage, Cloud Functions,
or hand-written SDK type shims, follow
`docs/CLOUDBASE_SDK_CONTRACT_VERIFICATION.md`.

- Read the relevant CloudBase skill/reference first.
- Verify the exact SDK/OpenAPI contract against official CloudBase docs or MCP
  docs, and against the installed package source/types in this repo.
- If Context7 or another live library-doc tool is available, use it. If it is not
  available, record that and use the CloudBase docs/OpenAPI tool plus installed
  package inspection.
- Do not add methods to `packages/db/src/wx-server-sdk.d.ts` unless the installed
  `wx-server-sdk` runtime exposes them.
- Run `pnpm verify:cloudbase-sdk` when touching CloudBase storage/media SDK
  integration, and keep that check green in CI.
